# Flappy Bird
According to Wikipedia, flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen
(Vietnamese: Nguyễn Hà Đông),under his game development company dotGears. The game is a side-scroller where the player
controls a bird, attempting to flybetween columns of green pipes without hitting them. Nguyen created the game over the
period of several days, using a bird protagonist that he had designed for a cancelled game in 2012.

The game was released in May 2013 but received a sudden rise in popularity in early 2014. Flappy Bird received poor reviews
from some critics, who criticized its high level of difficulty, plagiarism in graphics and game mechanics, while other
reviewers found it addictive. At the end of January 2014, it was the most downloaded free game in the App Store for iOS.
During this period, its developer said that Flappy Bird was earning $50,000 a day from in-app advertisements as well as sales.

This project is basically the remake of Flappy Bird using libGDX. Probably I won't update it anymore, though if someone wants
to fork it and add more functionalities, he/she's more than welcome.
